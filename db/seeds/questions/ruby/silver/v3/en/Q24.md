# Q24

## title

Given the following code, which is the correct result?

## body

```
m = true
m or n = true
p n
```

## options

### A

`true`

### B

`false`

### C+

`nil`

### D

A syntax error occurs.

## comment

Although the `or` operator short circuits and the `n = true` expression is never executed, the `n` local variable is still statically declared. Therefore, the variable is present but its value is `nil`.

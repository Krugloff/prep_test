## comment

The `sort_by` method maps the elements in a collection to a set of values via a block, and then sorts the elements of the collection in ascending order based on those values.

The `sort` method (when called without a block) sorts an array in ascending order directly based on the values of its elements. There is also a block form of `sort` which allows for element-by-element comparison.

Both `sort_by` and `sort` rely on the `<=>` operator to be defined in order to make comparisons between objects. Ruby's `Numeric` classes all implement this operator, but you can also define it for your own objects.

`array`

### B

### C+

### D

## comment

The `to_a` method uses the common naming convention for converting an object into an array, and is found throughout Ruby's collection classes.

Some objects also implement `to_ary`, which is used for implicit conversions. For example, `Array#flatten` will attempt to call `to_ary` on the elements within an array if it is present. But these use cases are uncommon.

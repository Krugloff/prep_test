## comment

`String#to_i` attempts to parse an integer from a string starting from its first character, and continuing until the end of a valid number in a particular base. If a string does not begin with a valid number, `0` is returned.

By default, numbers are assumed to be in base 10, but other bases (from `2` to `36`) can be specified via a parameter. 

Note that while `"42A7".to_i` returns `42` because `A` is not a valid part of a base 10 number, `"42A7".to_i(16)` would extract the hexadecimal value `0x42A7`, which when converted to decimal would be equal to `17063`.

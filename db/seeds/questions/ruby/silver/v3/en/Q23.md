# Q23

## title

Which of the following can be inserted into `__(1)__` in order for the given code to generate the output below?

## body

```
x = true
x __(1)__ exit(1)
puts("succeeded!")

[Output]
succeeded!
```

## options

### A

`|`

### B+

`||`

### C

`&`

### D

`&&`

## comment

The logical `||` and `&&` operators short-circuit, only executing the right side
of the expression if necessary.

The special `|` and `&` operators provided on Ruby's boolean objects do not short circuit, so the right side of the expression is always evaluated.

Note that all Ruby objects support the `||` and `&&` operators, but not all objects implement `|` and `&`.

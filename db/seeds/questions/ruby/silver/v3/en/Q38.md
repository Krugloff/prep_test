    super
  end
end

puts bar.var
```

## options

apple

### B

banana

### C

No output.

### D

An error occurs at run-time.

## comment

The `super` keyword invokes a method with the same name higher up the ancestry chain.

In this particular example, calling `Bar.new` causes `Bar#initialize` to run, which sets `@var = "banana"`. But then immediately after that, `super` is called, causing `Foo#initialize` to run. That method sets `@var = "apple"`, which explains the final result.

# Q9

## title

  x += i
end

p x
```

## options

### A

`0`

### B

### C+

`6`

### D

## comment

The `Integer#times` method yields values starting at zero, up to one less than the specified integer.

Although block variables with the same name of local variables from the surrounding scope are shadowed (see `A8`), other local variables are accessible and can be modified. This is because Ruby blocks are _closures_.

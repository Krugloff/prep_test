```

## options

### B+

An error occurs at run-time.

## comment

Ruby's numeric objects define a method called `coerce` which attempts to convert objects into the same type for arithmetic operations. This method is not implemented by the `String` class, so a `TypeError` is raised.

Note that if the order was reversed (i.e. `"hi" * 5`), then the result would be `"hihihihihi"`. This is because `String` does define its own `*` operator, which is used when the string appears on the left hand side of the expression.

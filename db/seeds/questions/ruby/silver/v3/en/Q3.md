# Q3

## title

Which variable name is valid in Ruby?

## options

### A

`3y`

### B

`false`

### C+

`_9class`

### E

`xyz$`

## comment

Ruby variable names must begin with a lowercase letter or underscore, and may contain only letters, numbers, underscore, and non-ASCII characters.

Variable names must not conflict with keywords (e.g. you cannot have a variable called `class`), but unambiguous names that contain reserved words are acceptable (i.e. both `classy` and `_class` are valid Ruby variable names)

# Q49

## title

Given the following code, which is the correct output?

## body

```
str = "bat"
str[1,1] = "o"
p str
```

## options

### A

`"boo"`

### B+

`"bot"`

### C

`"oat"`

### D

`"o"`

## comment

Note that the replacement string does not need to be the same length as the original string. For example:

```
>> str = "boat"
=> "boat"
>> str[1,2] = "uil"
=> "uil"
>> str
=> "built"
```

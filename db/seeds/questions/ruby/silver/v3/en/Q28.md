# Q28

## title

Which of the following methods will **NOT** show you if the element `:c` exists in the hash key or not?

## body

```
h = {a: 2, b: 4, c: 6, d: 8, e: 10}
```

## options

### A

`p h.has_key?(:c)`

### B+

`p h.contain?(:c)`

### C

`p h.include?(:c)`

### D

`p h.key?(:c)`

### E

`p h.member?(:c)`

## comment

`has_key?`, `include?`, `key?`, `member?` are all aliases for a single method which returns `true` if the given key is present in the hash, and returns `false` otherwise.

The `contain?` method is not defined by `Hash`.

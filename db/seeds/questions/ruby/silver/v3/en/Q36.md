# Q36

## title

Which of the following can be inserted into `__(1)__` in order for the given code to generate the output below?

## body

```
class Shouter
  def __(1)__(message)
    @message = message
  end

  def greet
    puts @message.upcase
  end
end

g = Shouter.new("Hello, world!")
g.greet

[Output]
HELLO, WORLD!
```

## options

### A

`Shouter`

### B

`new`

### C+

`initialize`

### D

`__init__`

## comment

Whenever the `new` method is called on a class, a new instance of that class is allocated and then the `initialize` method is called on that instance. This allows some setup code to be run as soon as the object is instantiated.

## comment

Although local variables from the surrounding scope are accessible within blocks, block parameters themselves are always block-local variables. This means that when a block parameter has the same name as a local variable from the surrounding scope, within the block any references will refer to the block-local variable. This prevents accidental modification of variables from the outside scope due to naming collisions.

Defining block parameters with the same name as a local variable from the surrounding scope is considered an antipattern and may be a sign of an accidental programming error. To catch this problem, run `ruby` with the `-w` flag, and you will see warnings like `warning: shadowing outer local variable - item` wherever this problem occurs.

# Q21

## title

Given the following code, which is the correct output?

## body

```
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
y = x
x.reject! { |e| e.even? }
p x
p y
```

## options

### A

```
[1, 3, 5, 7]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

### B

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

### C+

```
[1, 3, 5, 7]
[1, 3, 5, 7]
```

### D

```
[1, 3, 5, 7]
[2, 4, 6, 8]
```

## comment

In this example, both the `x` and `y` variables reference the same array object.

Because `Array#reject!` modifies its receiver, this means that it modifies the single array that is referenced by both variables.

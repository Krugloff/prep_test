  when 1..120; "S"
  when 120..170; "M"
  when 170..200; "L"
  else "XL"
end

p size
```

## options

### A+

`"S"`

### B

`"M"`

### C

`"L"`

### D

`"XL"`

## comment

Ruby `case` statements will select the first branch to match its `when` condition.

Because Ruby's two-dot range literal is an inclusive range, the end value is included as part of the range.

So although both `1..120` and `120..170` include `120`, the `when 1..120` branch is matched because it appears first in the case statement.

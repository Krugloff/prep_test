# Q34

## title

Which of the following statements appropriately applies to class in Ruby?

## body

**For a class which does not explicitly specify a superclass:**

## options

### A

an `UndefinedParentClassError` exception is raised

### B

a syntax error occurs

### C

the `Module` class becomes the superclass.

### D

the class is created without a superclass.

### E+

the `Object` class becomes the superclass.

## comment

By default, all classes inherit from the `Object` class, whether or not they are explicit subclasses of some other class.

To create class hierarchies that do not inherit from `Object`, it is possible to explictly inherit from `BasicObject` instead, which has very few features built into it. But the use cases for doing so are uncommon.

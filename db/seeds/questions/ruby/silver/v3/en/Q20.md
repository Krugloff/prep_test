Some notes on Ruby variable naming rules:

- Global variables start with `$`.
- Class variables start with `@@`.
- Instance variables start with `@`.
- Local variables must begin with a lowercase letter or an underscore.
- The remaining characters in any variable type are limited to letters, numbers, underscores, and non-ASCII characters.

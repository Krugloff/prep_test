# Q19

## title

Given the following code, which is the correct result?

## body

```
MSG = "hello"
MSG.upcase!
p MSG
```

## options

### A

An error occurs because MSG is a constant.

### B+

`HELLO` is displayed without warning.

### C

A warning apears because MSG is a constant but `HELLO` is displayed

### D

`hello` is displayed since MSG is a constant.

## comment

No warning is shown because the constant is not being redefined; instead the object it references is being modified.

By convention, objects referenced by constants are usually treated as immutable. But there are certain rare cases where that convention would not apply.

```

## options

### A

### B+

`sort { |i,j| -i <=> -j }`

### C

`sort { |i,j| i >= j }`

### D

`sort{ |i,j| i <=> j }`

## comment

When called with a block, `sort` will attempt to put elements in order based on the block's result.

The block must implement a comparison between two elements, and is expected to return a negative integer when the first element should appear before the second in the sorted array, `0` if the two elements have an equal sort order, and a postive integer when the first element should appear after the second in the sorted array.

Ruby's numeric objects implement `<=>`, which provides this behavior automatically:

```
>> 3 <=> 1
=> 1
>> 3 <=> 3
=> 0
>> 3 <=> 5
=> -1
```

The `<=>` (spaceship operator) can be implemented by any object that has a meaningful sort order.

## comment

This question illustrates two different ways of indexing a sub-array.

One approach is to use two integers, i.e. `x[1,3]`-- This means "get a subarray of length `3` starting at index `1`.

Another approach is to use a range, which generates a subarray based the index values within that range.

The simple form of using a range is something like `x[1..3]` which would give you a subarray starting at index `1` and ending at index `3`.

But Ruby also allows _negative_ indexing, which define indexes relative to the end of an array rather than the beginning.

Thus, `x[-4..-2]` is referring to the subarray starting from the 4th to the last position in the array, and continuing to the second-to-last position.

To clarify, here is a list of the index values for each position in the array from this question:

```
 x  [ 9,   7,   5,    3,    1]
 i    0    1    2     3     4
-i   -5   -4   -3    -2    -1
```

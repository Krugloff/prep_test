## comment

Some notes on array processing methods:

- In addition to `reject!` there is also `reject`, which returns a new array rather than modifying the original.
- Because there isn't a non-destructive form of `delete_if`, there is no `delete_if!` method. By convention Ruby only uses `!` at the end of the method when there are two features that work similarly but with one being more dangerous than the other.
- The `Array#slice` method works similarly to `Array#[]`, and is used for retrieving a specific value or subarray by index rather than filtering based on a condition. It does not accept a block.

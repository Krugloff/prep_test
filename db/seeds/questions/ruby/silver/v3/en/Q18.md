# Q18

## title

Given the following code, which is the correct result?

## body

```
MSG = 42
MSG += 5
p MSG
```

## options

### A

`47` is displayed without warning.

### B

An error occurs because MSG is a constant.

### C

`42` is displayed because MSG is a constant.

### D+

A warning appears beacuse MSG is a constant but `47` is displayed.

## comment

Constants can be redefined, but because this is usually a bad practice, a warning is displayed.

Because Ruby also uses constants for referencing module and class names, the constant redefinition warning can also help catch accidental naming collisions.

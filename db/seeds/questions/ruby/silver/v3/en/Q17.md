# Q17

## title

Which of the following regular expressions only match the string "Ruby" or "ruby"?

## options

### A+

`/\A[Rr]uby\z/`

### B

`/\ARuby|ruby\z/`

### C+

`/\A[Rr][u][b][y]\z/`

### D

`/\AR|ruby\z/`

## comment

Character classes (`[...]`) match any single character from within the brackets.

Alternatives (`...|...`) are used to match any one of many possible subexpressions.

The `\A` anchor matches the beginning of a string, and the `\z` anchor matches the end of a string.

_Note that the reason that (b) is not a correct answer is because its subexpressions are `\ARuby` and `ruby\z`, allowing matches for things like `Ruby123`_

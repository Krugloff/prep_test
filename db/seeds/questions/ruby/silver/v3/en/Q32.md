## comment

In a `begin/rescue/end` block... the first matched `rescue` clause will be executed.

Because `SomeOtherError` is a subclass of `SomeError`, it matches the `rescue SomeError` clause, and so that branch is what gets run.

In a real application, it is usually a good practice to attempt to match more specific errors before the more general errors that they inherit from (e.g. `rescue StandardError` would usually come last).

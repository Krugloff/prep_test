## comment

Single quoted string literals are simple, and are meant to represent raw sequences of characters.

Double quoted string literals are more complex, but offer extra features such as string interpolation (`#{...}`), where entire Ruby expressions can be evaluated and inserted into a string.

As a shortcut, `#$` is usable for inserting the contents of a global variable into a string. (Similarly, `#@` can be used with instance variables). This shortcut variant is less commonly used than the more general `#{...}` form.

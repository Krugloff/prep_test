## comment

Dividing by zero raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception.

That exception is rescued, and a message is printed out. Then `exit(1)` tells Ruby to exit with an error code.

But because the `begin...end` expression has an `ensure` section, it is run before the interpreter exits.

The `ensure` clause is useful because it can be used to do cleanup even when some code raises an exception or tells Ruby to exit. It is often used for things like closing file handles, database connections, etc.

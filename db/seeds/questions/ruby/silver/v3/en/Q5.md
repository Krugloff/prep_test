## comment

A leading zero in an integer literal indicates 'octal-mode' in Ruby, i.e. a number in base 8 format. However, all print functions in Ruby will output numeric values in base 10 by default.

Should you need to output numbers in something other than base 10, there are many different functions in Ruby for formatted numeric output (e.g. `String#%`, `Numeric#to_s(base)`, `Kernel#sprintf`)

## comment

Because classes are objects in Ruby, it is possible to define class instance variables.

All objects in Ruby also have a *singleton class* associated with them, even class objects.

In this example, there is an instance variable named `@message` on the `Speaker` class as well as on the singleton class of `Speaker`. These are two seperate variables.

The singleton method `Speaker.speak` is evaluated in the context of the `Speaker` class, and so `@message` refers to the instance variable defined within the `Speaker` class definition, and not the instance variable defined within the singleton class of `Speaker`.

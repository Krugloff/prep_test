## comment

In this example, the `greet` method was defined on the `Mixin` module itself, rather than defined as a method that can be mixed into other objects.

(To see how to define methods that can both be mixed into objects and called directly on a module, look up information about Ruby's `module_function` feature, or the `extend self` convention.)

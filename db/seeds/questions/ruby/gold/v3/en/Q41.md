## comment

The `extend` method is used to mix a module into a single object. When used within a class definition, `extend` refers to the class itself, and therefore the methods from the mixed in module become available as class methods.

But `extend` can also be used with any object, i.e.

```
obj = Object.new
obj.extend(Mixin)
obj.greet
```

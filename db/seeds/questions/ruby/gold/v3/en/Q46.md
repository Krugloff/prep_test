## title

Which option corresponds to the execution result?

## body

**Given the following code:**

```
class TShirt
  SIZES = [:xs, :s, :m, :l, :xl, :xxl]

  include Comparable

  def initialize(size)
    @size = size
  end
  
  attr_reader :size

  def <=>(other)
    SIZES.index(size) <=> SIZES.index(other.size)
  end
end

medium = TShirt.new(:m)
large  = TShirt.new(:l)

p medium == large
p medium <  large
p medium <= large
p medium >  large
p medium >= large
```

## options

### A

## comment

The `Comparable` module provides all of the comparison methods used in this example (`<`, `<=`, `==`, `>=`, `>`).

Each of these methods rely on the presence of a `<=>` operator which returns a negative number, zero, or a positive number depending on the sort order of two values. Ruby's core `Numeric` classes all implement this functionality, and so the following example with integers should help clarify:

```
3 <=> 8 # -1
8 <=> 8 #  0
8 <=> 3 #  1
```

With this example in mind, you can think of `Comparable`'s implementation of `<` as looking something like what you see below:

```
def <(other)
  (self <=> other) < 0
end
```

Like `Enumerable`, the `Comparable` mixin is a good example of how modules tend to rely on only a small amount of functionality being implemented by the classes they're mixed into in order to make all their features work.

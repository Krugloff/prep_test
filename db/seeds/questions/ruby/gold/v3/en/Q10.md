## comment

Class variables are shared not just within a single class, but also downwards through the inheritance hierachy. So when `A` defines `@@x`, that variable is shared with its child classes `B` and `C`, and all three reference the same variable.

Class variables are one of the more complex features of Ruby, and so this study guide does not cover anything beyond their most basic behaviors.

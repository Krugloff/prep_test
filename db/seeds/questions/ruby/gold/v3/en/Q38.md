# Q38

## title

Which option corresponds to the execution result?

## body

**Given the following code:**

```
module Mixin
  def this_object
    self
  end
end

class Identity
  include Mixin
end


p Identity.new.this_object.class
```

## options

### A

`Mixin`

### B

`Class`

### C

`Object`

### D+

`Identity`

## comment

Even in complex ancestry chains including module mixins and class inheritance, `self` will always refer to receiving object within the current context. 

In this particular example, that means that even though the `this_object` is defined by the `Mixin` module, it is included into and called on an instance of the `Identity` class, and therefore `self` refers to that specific object.

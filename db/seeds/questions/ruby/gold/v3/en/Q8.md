## comment

Every method in Ruby may accept a block, whether it is explicitly specified in the method signature or not.

The `yield` keyword is used for calling a block implicitly.
The `&block` syntax is used for converting the block into a `Proc` object, which can then be invoked via `call()`, or passed along to some other method, etc.

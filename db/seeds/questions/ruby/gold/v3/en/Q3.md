# Q3

## title

Which option can be inserted into `__(1)__`?

## body

**Assume that the following code must have the stated execution result:**

```
x = __(1)__
p x + 1

[Execution Result]
(4/3)
```

## options

### A+

`1 / 3r`

### B

`1 / 3R`

### C

`1 / %r(3)`

### D

`1 / 3`

## comment

Suffixing a literal number with `r` tells Ruby to construct a `Rational` object. The same result can be achieved in a few other ways as well (e.g. `1 / 3.to_r` or `Rational(1, 3)`)

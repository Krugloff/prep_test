# Q30

## title

Which option can be inserted into `__(1)__`?

## body

**Assume that the following code must have the stated execution result:**

```
begin
  __(1)__
rescue
  puts "OK"
end

[Execution Result]
OK
```

## options

### A+

`raise StandardError`

### B

`raise Exception`

### C+

`raise ArgumentError`

### D

`raise ScriptError`

## comment

The ancestry chain for each of the classes listed in this question is as follows:

```
ArgumentError < StandardError < Exception

ScriptError < Exception
```

If `rescue` is called without a specific error class, it will catch `StandardError` and its descendents by default. Most exceptions in core Ruby are descendents of `StandardError`, but there are some that are not usually meant to be rescued which exist in other class hierarchies which descend directly from the `Exception` base class.

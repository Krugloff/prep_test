## comment

The `class << ...` syntax is used to open up the singleton class of an object, allowing methods to be defined on that specific object.

Because classes are objects in Ruby, it is possible to add methods directly to classes in this way, for example:

```
class << Greeter
  def hello
    # ...
  end
end
```

But the more common way is to use `class << self` from within a class body as shown in the question's code.

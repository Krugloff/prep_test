## body

**Given the following code:**

```
AnError = Class.new(Exception)

begin
  raise AnError
rescue
  puts "Bare rescue"
rescue StandardError
  puts "StandardError rescue"
rescue AnError
  puts "AnError rescue"
rescue Exception
  puts "Exception rescue"
end
```

## options

### A

```
Bare rescue
```

### B

```
StandardError rescue
```

### C+


```
AnError rescue
```

### D


```
Exception rescue
```

### E

```
AnError rescue
Exception rescue
```

## comment

A bare `rescue` statement matches `StandardError` and its descendents. As such, it will not match any exceptions which inherit from the `Exception` base class directly.

Within a single `begin/end` block, only the first matched `rescue` clause will be run, even if there are multiple clauses that match.

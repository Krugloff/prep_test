# Q16

## title

Which option can be inserted into `__(1)__`?

## body

**Assume that the following code must have the stated execution result:**

```
obj = Object.new

def obj.hello
  puts "Hi!"
end

copy = __(1)__

copy.hello

[Execution Result]
Hi!
```

## options

### A

`Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(obj))`

### B

`obj.dup`

### C+

`obj.clone`

### D

`obj.copy`

## comment

Also note that:

- `Object#dup` does not copy an object's singleton methods.
- `Marshal.dump` is unable to serialize objects that have singleton methods defined on them.
- There is no `Object#copy` method.

## title

What is the direct superclass of the `Class` class?

## options

### A

`Object`

### B+

`Module`

### C

`BasicObject`

### D

`Class`

## comment

Even though the `Class` class is a subclass of `Module`, class objects cannot be used as mixins (i.e. you cannot use a `Class` object with `include`, `extend`, or `prepend`)

The class inheritance relationship between `Module` and `Class` in Ruby is mostly an implementation detail, as the two constructs have some overlapping functionality and purposes--but neither is a pure behavioral subtype of the other.

pop = __(1)__{ words.pop }
3.times{ puts pop.call }

[Execution Result]

banana
apple
```

## options

### A+

`Proc.new`

### B

`Block.new`

### C+

`lambda`

### D

`Lambda.new`

## comment

Although `Proc.new` and `lambda` each create a `Proc` object, they are not identical to one another in behavior. 

- A `Proc` generated via `lambda` is strict about its accepted arguments, whereas an ordinary `Proc` will ignore extra unused arguments. 

- A `return` call from within a `lambda` returns from the lambda itself, whereas a `return` call from an ordinary `Proc` object will return from the method that invoked the block.

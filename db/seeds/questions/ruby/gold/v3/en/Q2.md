# Q2

## title

Which option corresponds to the execution result?

## body

**Given the following code:**

```
module I
end

module P
end

class C
  include I
  prepend P
end

p C.ancestors
```

## options

### A+

`[P, C, I, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]`

### B

`[C, P, I, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]`

### C

`[C, I, Object, Kernel, BasicObject, P]`

### D

`[P, I, C, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]`

## comment

- A class that does not explicitly specify its parent class automatically inherits from `Object`, which mixes in the `Kernel` module and inherits from `BasicObject`.

- Modules mixed into a class via `include` appear between that class and its parent class in the ancestry chain.

- Modules mixed into a class via `prepend` appear before that class in the ancestry chain.

Using `prepend` is only necessary when you either want to override some definition in the class you are extending with a module mixin. Otherwise, `include` works fine, even for overriding functionality of modules that have already been included.

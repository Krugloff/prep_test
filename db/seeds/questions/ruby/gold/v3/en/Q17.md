## title

Which option can be inserted into `__(1)__`?

## body

**Assume that the following code must have the stated execution result:**

```
class ShoppingList
  def initialize
    @items = []
  end

  def add_item(item)
    @items << item
  end

  def __(1)__
    @items.map { |e| "- #{e}" }.join("\n")
  end
end

list = ShoppingList.new

list.add_item("Milk")
list.add_item("Bread")
list.add_item("Eggs")

puts list

[Execution Result]
- Milk
- Bread
- Eggs
```

## options

### A+

`to_s`

### B

`to_str`

### C

`inspect`

### D

`puts`

## comment

Many Ruby methods (including `Kernel#puts`) call `to_s` in order to convert objects into a string representation. The default implementation of `Object#to_s` produces simple, generic output which looks like this: 

`#<ShoppingList:0x007fb651918610>`

When the `to_s` method is overidden in other objects, it can be used to provide a better string representation of the object, as shown in this question.

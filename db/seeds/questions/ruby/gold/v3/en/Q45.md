# Q45

## title

Which of the following options can be inserted into `__(1)__`?

## body

**Assume that the following code must have the stated execution result:**

```
class Alphabet
  include Enumerable

  def initialize
    @letters = ("A".."Z").to_a
  end

  def __(1)__
    @letters.each do |e|
      yield e
    end
  end
end

set = Alphabet.new

p set.take(5)
p set.select { |e| e > "W" }

[Execution Result]
["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]
["X", "Y", "Z"]
```

## options

### A

`all`

### B+

`each`

### C

`to_a`

### D

`to_ary`

### E

`to_enum`

## comment

The `Enumerable` mixin expects that any object it is mixed into will implement an `each` method, which yields elements one by one to a block. The many list processing features of `Enumerable` are all implemented on top of `each` in some way or another.

To understand `Enumerable` better, it can help to think about how each of its features might be implemented manually. For example, suppose that `each` has already been defined, then a `select` method could be defined as follows:

```
def select(&b)
  matched = []
  
  each { |e| matched << e if b.call(e) }
  
  matched
end
```

This general pattern is common in mixins: functionality is provided based on a very simple contract with the mixed in object, where you only need to implement a small piece of glue code in order to make use of its features.

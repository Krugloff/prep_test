# Q4

## title

Which of the following options can be inserted into `__(1)__`?

## body

**Assume that the following code must have the stated execution result:** 

```
p ("aaaaaa".."zzzzzz").lazy.select { |e| e.end_with?("f") }.__(1)__

[Execution Result]
["aaaaaf", "aaaabf", "aaaacf"]
```

## options

### A+

`first(3)`

### B

`take(3)`

### C+

`take(3).force`

### D

`first(3).force`

## comment

The `take()` method is defined by `Enumerator::Lazy`, and so execution is deferred until enumeration is forced in some way. (The return value of this method will be an `Enumerator::Lazy` object)

An `Enumerator::Lazy` object inherits from `Enumerator` and also includes the `Enumerable` module.

Calling an `Enumerable` method that isn't overridden by `Enumerator::Lazy` will force enumeration. This is why calling `first(3)` does not require (or allow) calling the `.force` method afterwards: Its return value is an `Array`, not an `Enumerable::Lazy` object, and the operation is executed immediately.

Note that the `force()` method on `Enumerator::Lazy` is just an alias for `Enumerable#to_a`.

Which option corresponds to the execution result?

## body

**Given the following code:**

```
AnError = Class.new(Exception)

begin
  raise AnError
rescue
  puts "Bare rescue"
rescue StandardError
  puts "StandardError rescue"
rescue Exception
  puts "Exception rescue"
rescue AnError
  puts "AnError rescue"  
end
```

## options

### A

```
Bare rescue
```

### B

```
StandardError rescue
```

### C

```
AnError rescue
```

### D+

```
Exception rescue
```

### E

```
Exception rescue
AnError rescue
```

## comment

Even though `rescue Exception` and `rescue AnError` both match the raised exception, in this example the `rescue Exception`  clause appears first in the block, and so that branch is executed and all the remaining `rescue` clauses that follow it are ignored.
